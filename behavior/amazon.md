-   Be specific in terms of quantifying results: for example, after completion the project, the latency reduce 50% and the service is able to handle 2x traffic
-   Be positive: especially in question of failure, what is most important is what you learn from past mistakes.
-   Study 14 leadership principles. For engineer role, you can skip 2 principles: hire and develop the best, frugality.
